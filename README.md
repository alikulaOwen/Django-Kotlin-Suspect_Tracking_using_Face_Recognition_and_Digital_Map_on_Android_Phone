# Suspect Tracking using Face Recognition and Digital Map on Android Phone

This is a survellance system which uses machine learning face detection and recognition technology. CCTV cameras covering and area are used to scan people's faces and send back data to the Tafuta-Api Server which performs the face recognition and updates the locations of known suspect.
The locations of this known suspect are then displayed on Google Maps using an Android Device.
